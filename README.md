🦠 COVID-19 Data Analysis using Pandas & Matplotlib

📘 Overview
This project performs data analysis and visualization on the global COVID-19 dataset from Our World in Data (OWID).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Calculates mean, median, maximum, and total cases
Computes correlation between new cases and deaths
Displays dataset coverage and statistics

Visualizations:
📈 Global daily new cases trend (line chart)
📊 Top 10 countries by total cases (bar chart)
🗓️ Monthly average trend of new cases (line chart)
All charts are automatically saved in the covid_visualizations/ directory.
